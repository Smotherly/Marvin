# Marvin
An attempt on [Darwin's](https://github.com/42stones/Darwin) theme.

# Mga Suliranin

1. The extension's page on the VS Marketplace.

2. Some of the strings being mixed up through how it was named.

3. Title bar, Explorer, Extra buttons, and sometimes the Status bar not fitting the theme's core values.

# Designed for VSCodium
### This was composed in that [editor](https://vscodium.com) for it using the same binaries, or atleast 1:1 ratio in design and functionability.

###### If i had enough resources and confidence I would try to do that special thing and port this theme (if finished) to it.

## I wonder if 42stones is still around, I could ask a couple of questions but he might not answer a couple because [Microsoft](https://t.ly/fINE) developed VS Code further since Darwin's last update.
